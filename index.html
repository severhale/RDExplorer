            <h2>What is reaction diffusion?</h2>
            <p>Reaction diffusion refers to a class of interactions between two agents with two requirements. Both agents must diffuse over time, and must interact with each other. They were discovered by Alan Turing in his 1952 paper, The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis, who proposed that this model could explain many types of natural, autonomous pattern formation. The applicability of the model was disputed for many years, but over time, compelling examples of the modelâ€™s usefulness led to its acceptance.</p>
            <p>In nature, things tend to constantly spread and even themselves out. Many things diffuse in a way similar to the way one normally thinks a gas does, just at drastically different speeds. Water smooths itself out, as does sand, as does a mountain - eventually. For this reason, the reaction diffusion model is applicable to many phenomena in nature. Ordinary two-variable reaction diffusion (typically using the Gray-Scott model) has been used for applications ranging from biological and chemical to purely artistic. In biology, it has been used as a model to understand why certain patterns appear so often in nature, and to model growth of things like malignant tumors.</p>
            <h2>Where can we go from here?</h2>
            <p>Reaction-diffusion is one of a few growth models which presents exciting possibilities to artists and biologists alike in that it provides a convincing, accurate model for certain types of natural growth. Here, you can explore the many extensions and variations of this model to various ends such as 3D-printed art, complex 2D digital art, and architecture.</p>

                <p>This is a project by Nervous System, a generative design studio based in Boston, MA, USA. The basis of their design is using Turing patterns as bump maps for plates and other houseware, and then 3D printing it!</p>
                <p>Nervous System is a huge resource for natural growth simulation projects, and I highly recommend looking into their other work. Although not quite reaction-diffusion, <a href="http://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/blog/?p=6721">Floraform</a> has an incredibly detailed explanation of their method for simulating differential growth to create beautiful, flower-like shapes.</p>

                <p>Daniel Christev explores the possiblities of using reaction-diffusion as a basis for architecture. This makes sense as a concept, because reaction-diffusion is nature's way organizing things so that they're spaced out nicely. He tries out 3D reaction-diffusion but finds it to be too chaotic and complex. However, 3D models of 2D reaction diffusion with time as the third axis (as I have demonstrated in the simulations tab) was much more promising.</p>

                <p>Andrew Werth's painting are inspired by reaction-diffusion. Interestingly, he also uses Photoshop to generate Turing patterns by repeatedly blurring and sharpening. You can read his paper <a href="http://m.archive.bridgesmathart.org/2015/bridges2015-459.pdf">here</a> and watch a video of this process <a href="https://vimeo.com/61154654">here</a>.</p>

                <p>Moritz's video series outlines a way to create genuine 3D reaction-diffusion (using point clouds and everything) with the popular graphics software Houdini. By constraining the growth to within a mesh, he's able to create meaningful shapes out of the blobs that are produced by a 3D Gray-Scott model.</p>
